God had another direction for my path but many years later He has allowed me the opportunity to do something with that dream. So over a year ago I started recording a couple podcasts and I have fallen in love with it. It would be easy for me to tell you that I have a long way to go but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy doing it while learning along the way. I am currently hosting three different shows. Each are featured here. If you enjoy them please like, share and rate them. I also welcome any suggestions on show topics and people you know who would make great guests. Contact me by email @ rogtarheel@gmail.com or on my social media links below."
